# Imagine-Android
The Android-App with all its flaws and defects!

Currently, the iOS version is the prototype of the Imagine Network. I made the Android version for friends, family and a helping student group, because over 60/70% of Germans use Android, not iOS. Therefore it only provides the basic features, like an endless feed, sign-up/log-in and posting different media objects. With so many Android developers around, I hope we will get the App to the standard of the iOS prototype in no time!

# The Network:
Imagine tries to be a social and entertaining place. A lot of open source and decentralized networks have tried it, so will we. We do not only focus on the serious parts, but try to find a responsible and fun way to get a new network.
We are young and want an up-to-date network without the nasty side effects. We want to give something back and want to build it with the community. Its more fun and effective!

You can find more informations about our ways of diminishing a bad mental state, fake news/populism and echochambers on our website: www.tiny.cc/JustImagine (Currently just in the German language)

# Features:
- *Endless-Feed*: 
Post thoughts, pictures, YouTubeVideos and Links
Upvote the post in four different ways (no downvotes for the social concept see manifesto on website).
The feed is last-in, first-out for now. Our goal is to prevent a echo chamber, so this works as long as there are not too many users.

- *User*:
You can add a profile picture to your account 

(See https://github.com/ImagineSocial/Imagine-iOS for all of the prototype features)
We use Firebase as a provider for the authentification process, storage and database. This has been a great solution so far.

# so...
there is a lot to do, especially with the android app, but we are here, there is no kickstarter between us and the market and we will make the necessary additions and changes together. It seems like there are a lot of talented programmer for Android applications, so I am confident, that we will find a team to elevate this app to a real experience. The idea needs optimisation too, but we will find a market fit, gather smart people and keep on working for the change!

If you are interested to help, you can interact with us via the app, send us a message on Facebook/Instagram, here on GitHub or however you can reach us. We need help in so many areas: UI/UX, Programming (in Kotlin/Java, Swift/ObjectiveC, Javascript...), translations (in english & persian for the beginning)... In short, if you are smart and/or motivated, we are happy for your help!
